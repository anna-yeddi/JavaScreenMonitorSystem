#JavaScreenMonitoringSystem
was written by Anna Kova on December 5, 2018.

This application is aimed to monitor the activity on the computer where it's run,
by taking every 5 seconds screenshots of the main screen and storing them in the 
dedicated DropBox folder. All processes are performed in the background.

Thank you for your interest!
